Draft for Monitor lang. Has to be ascii.

In monitor, you watch over interpreter state with a monitor, you can view what has changed by using some commands in the lang.

There needs to be some way to execute commands, so you probably need to send the commands to the interpreter with an execution predicate, via some kind of messenging system. You can tell it to do stuff, or tell it to stop (under some condition), etc.

A low-level language, work with hardware addresses directly. But as usual, there's an easy and straightforward way to map an array by a function.
